# TicTacToe using Min-Max Algorithm

In this project, I have developed a desktop application which allows a user to play TicTacToe against the computer. <br>
To find the best possible move for the computer at every point of the game, here I have used the MinMax algorithm for decision making.

Code for the AI is written in C++. <br>
A graphical interface is provided for the user using the Qt Framework.

Compilation of the project requires Qt Creator.
